open new terminal and run npm run dev
open another new terminal and run php artisan serve

Info : 
There are 2 models created one is Membership and another is shortlink

Membership model is responsible to tractk the users membership data such as how many links user can consume
also user can upgrade its membership plan as well.

Shortlink module is used to track the generated shortlink or we can say it handles the main logic of storing short links
and its mapping with the actual link.

Functionalities : 
1)user can register,log in and log out.
2)he can create short link, edit the short link details he cant edit the generated shortlink, instead he can deactivete it or delete same.
3)user can upgrade its membership.
4)User can see all the links created by him and click on the short link to check its working.
To start just go to the host url and register with new user and then you can explore the rest other things.
Note : I have used Dummy domain as url.to in this project and just showcased the functionality using url route.
